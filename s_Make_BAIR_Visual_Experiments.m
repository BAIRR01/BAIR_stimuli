% 1. HRF
%       Exponential ISI, mean 9, range 3-24 s, interpolated to fit TR
% 2. TASK
%       12 s fixation task, 12 s relax, repeat 8 times (to measure anticipatory BOLD)
% 3. RETINOTOPY
%       Like Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008: 8 sweeps: 4 cardinal, 4 diagonal (diagonals include 50% blanks)
% 4. SPATIOTEMPORAL
%        VISUAL: 36 unique stimuli, shown once each per scan (0.5 s except for temporal stimuli),
%                with mean ISI of 4.5 s, range 3-6 s; orientation (3; 1 grating, 1 plaid, 1 circular);
%                contrast (5; noise patterns); spacing: (5: noise patterns, 1 overlaps with contrast);
%                objects (12: 4 faces, 4 letters, 4 houses); temporal (12; 6 durations; 6 ISIs);
